# Bamazon
## Overview
BAMAZON is a Amazon-esque storefront app that displays available products. The user will be asked what they would like to purchase, in addition to the quantity. If there is enough stock for the item, user will receive a "successful" result with the total due. If there is not enough stock for the item, user will receive an "error" message, and be asked to try again. If a purchase is successful, the user will have the option to continue shopping, or "quit", which will exit the application.

### The application will show the available products to the user, and questions will be prompted regarding what they would like to purchase and the quantity

### If the user has input their request AND there is enough inventory to complete the order, they will be given a "recap" of what was purchased and their total due. They will then be prompted to continue shopping or not.

### If the user's order request exceeds the current inventory, they will receive a "error" message alerting them there are not enough of the specific product they are looking for in inventory, and to please try again.

### If the user selects "YES" to continue shopping, the product list will be re-displayed with the updated quantity from previous purchase and prompted as to what they would like to purchase
