# Bamazon
## Overview
BAMAZON is a Amazon-esque storefront app that displays available products. The user will be asked what they would like to purchase, in addition to the quantity. If there is enough stock for the item, user will receive a "successful" result with the total due. If there is not enough stock for the item, user will receive an "error" message, and be asked to try again. If a purchase is successful, the user will have the option to continue shopping, or "quit", which will exit the application.
